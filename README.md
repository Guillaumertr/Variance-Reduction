# Variance Reduction Techniques in Option Pricing

This notebook showcases essential **Monte Carlo variance reduction methods** used in pricing European-style options. These techniques are crucial when dealing with simulations, as they significantly **reduce estimator variance**, improving both speed and accuracy.

---

## Objectives

- Implement and compare multiple variance reduction techniques.
- Evaluate their efficiency relative to the standard Monte Carlo method.
- Use each technique to estimate the price of a European call option.

---

## Implemented Techniques

### Antithetic Variates
Generate pairs of negatively correlated paths by inverting Brownian increments. Averaging results from each pair reduces variance.

### Control Variates (naive, practitionner, adaptative)
Leverage the known price of a correlated instrument (like the analytical Black-Scholes price) to adjust the Monte Carlo estimator.

---

## Outputs

- Side-by-side comparison of the **estimated prices**, **standard deviations**, and **confidence intervals**.
- Visualization of the **convergence speed** for each method.
- Illustration of **variance reduction factor** to quantify efficiency.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Variance reduction is essential to make Monte Carlo pricing methods more **practical in production**.
- Properly applied, these techniques can **reduce simulation cost by orders of magnitude**.
- The choice of method depends on the **payoff function**, **dimensionality**, and **known analytical results**.
